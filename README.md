JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

## Description

This JavaScript application allows employees to generate random passwords based on their selected criteria. It provides a user-friendly interface where employees can specify the length of the password and choose from various options such as including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

The motivation behind building this project was to provide a convenient tool for employees to generate strong and secure passwords that meet their specific requirements. By using this application, employees can easily create unique passwords that help protect their accounts and sensitive information.

This application solves the problem of coming up with strong passwords that are difficult to guess or crack. It eliminates the need for employees to manually think of complex passwords and provides a reliable way to generate random passwords that meet the desired criteria.

Through building this project, I learned about JavaScript programming concepts such as generating random numbers, manipulating strings, and working with user input.
